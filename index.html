    <h3>What Am I?</h3>
    <p>I am interested in economics, philosophy, and mathematics. I see them not just as subjects or majors, but as tools for how we can see and understand the world. I have faith in myself and who I will be. </p>

    <h3>What Do I Think?</h3>
    <p>I live in California. I love this nation and what it stands for. I see freedom and individualism as the most important qualities in this world. I believe in the phrase " give me liberty or give me death.‚Äù I see liberty is not just a political ideology, but a foundation of human progress. A thriving market and a spirit of innovation are what drive humanity forward, while any rigid system, no matter its purpose, will eventually collapse under its own weight.</p>

    <p>I love to see myself as a thinker and a builder. I want to create, contribute, and leave something meaningful for society and for the world we share.</p>
