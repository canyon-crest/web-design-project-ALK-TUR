      <h3>What Do I Think?</h3>
      <img src="images/Flag_of_California.svg.png" height="100" width="200" class="float-right" alt="Flag of California">
      <p>I live in <a href="https://www.ca.gov/" target="_blank"> California</a>. I love this nation and what it stands for. I see freedom and individualism as the most important qualities in this world. I believe in the phrase " give me liberty or give me death.‚Äù I see liberty is not just a political ideology, but a foundation of human progress. A thriving market and a spirit of innovation are what drive humanity forward, while any rigid system, no matter its purpose, will eventually collapse under its own weight.</p>
